# 🤖 CrewAI Software Engineering Team

## 📖 Summary

CrewAI Software Engineering Team is a multi-agent AI system that simulates a real-world software development workflow. Given a set of high-level requirements, the system automatically designs, develops, tests, and creates a frontend for a Python application using specialized AI agents.

This project demonstrates how autonomous AI agents can collaborate to perform software engineering tasks, including system design, backend implementation, frontend generation, and automated test creation.
